# YAML Inventory plugin

Ansible offers different kinds of inventory plugins. They are configured with
the directive **enable_plugins** in the *ansible.cfg* file.

```
[inventory]
...
enable_plugins = host_list, script, auto, yaml, ini, toml
```

The **ini** plugin is the default one.
The **yaml** plugin lets manage inventories in yaml format, wich gives many
advantages in terms of clarity of the inventory.
